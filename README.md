# S120 KiCad Schematics

This repository contains a KiCad rebuild of the Stereoscan-120 schematics.

For the schematics will only represent the high level wiring of the instrument. On  one hand we do not yet know the copyright situation of the schematics and on the other we are currently only doing a high level analysis of the functionality.

Later on exact schematics might be added!

## Structure

Every PCB is represented by a hierarchical sheet and all connectors to this PCB are represented as hierarchical pins. The names of the pins are the names of the connectors, as per the printed schematics.

The top level schematic should eventually contain the entire wiring diagram.
